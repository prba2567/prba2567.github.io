    <h2> When I was taking the CSCI 1300: Computer Science 1: Starting Computing, the final project was one best things I did when it comes to coding. My partner Aala Al Maskari and I were pretty extra on this project. So, the project is a multi-layerd game that we built using c++. Since there was two of us woeking in this project, we wanted to create some partner games. So, we thought of combing two different cartoon or animation lores and making that into a game. Soon, we came up with MiniMunks. MiniMunks is combing both the Minion's lore with Alvin and the Chipmunk. So this game starts with a menu with many individual games involving each lore and also games that combine the two. </h2>

    <h2> Here is walkthroug of the game </h2>
