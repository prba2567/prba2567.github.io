    <h1>Changelog</h1>
    <h2> Page 1</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Error 1 : The page was missing the Doctype html tag. So, I added it. </li>
        <li>Error 2 : In a paragraph the ending tag for the paragraph was incorrect as it missed the /. So, I added a / to make it a ending tag. </li>
        <li>Error 3 : There is a em tag where the ending tag did not have a / and ended in e instead of em. So, I added a m and the / to the ending tag. </li>
        <li>Error 4 : There was no html tag in the page. So, I added that and put lang = "en" due to a warning I got. </li>
        <li>Error 5 : The meta tag in the head element is missing. So, I added those tags.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Page 2</h2>
    <ul> 
        <li>Error 1 : The bold  ending tag around Beehive Inn is incomplete. So, I completed the ending tag by adding a / and a b. </li>
        <li>Error 2 : The h2 should not be in between b tag. It's the other way around, so I fixed it.</li>
        <li>Error 3 : The link "where do I go" is not a actual link attached to the a tag for segmental arch and there is no site called brokenlink.com that is attached to the word bay. So, I linked a wkipedia page of segmental arch and bay respectivly.</li>
        <li>Error 4 : This is more of an organisation thing, but the heading subsections vary from different header sizes. So I hchanged it all to a h3.</li>
       


    </ul>
    <h2>Page 3</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Error 1 : A l element is not supposed to a child element of ul; however, in this context it seems like it was supposed to be a li tag instead of a l tag. So I just added a i to to the beginning and ending tag.</li>
        <li>Error 2 : There were mutliple instances where the td tag was not complete or in a place that did not have a tr tag around it. So I either completed the tag or moved a td tag into a tr tag. </li>
        <li>Error 3 : This is more of a organizational issues than a coding error, but the information of the table does not match its row/ column. So, I fixed that by moving the td tags around and fixing a unessarily bolded word.</li>
        
    </ul>
    <h2>Page 4</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Error 1 : All the image elements do not have a alt atribute. So I gave all of them a alt artibute.</li>
        <li>Error 2 : There is no Doctype html tag. So I added that.</li>
        <li>Error 3 : The were multiple issues involving the td tag, whether it be it missing a closing tag, or missing that tag all together. I added td tags where they were missing.
        <li>Error 4 : The pictures on the page does not match the rows that they are on. So I switched the positions of the pictures.</li>
    </ul>
