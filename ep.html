    <h1> Better Block 3000</h1>
    <h2>My final project for GEEN 1400: Engineering projects was finding a problem and bulding a solution in a team. After much disscusion, we were aiming to find a solution for spreading cold butter.
    Based on looking what current solutions are in the market and brain storming we found that a heated knife block would be best. Not only will it accomplish the task of spreading butter, but has versatility that goes beyond our problem. This is because we desinged the knife block where the top half behaves like a regular knife but the bottom compartment has a self within it that we heat water to a specific tempertaure to heat the knife thus cut through butter. Just like how chefs it professional kitchen heat up knives. We also added a extra large slot on the knife block that could fit other utesils like spoons to cut through ice cream.
