    <h2> Generally I really enjoy animation. Mostly 2d cartoonish styles. The most recent animation I have done so far was in ATLS 2100: Image. This was project 2 where we had to create videos of image in motion. Here I challened myself to only use photoshop. I created all my assets in photoshop then aninmated it in keyframe animation. The story is about this mysterious woman that walks through the desert until she notices that the night sky has no moon or stars so she uses her powers to add them to the sky. </h2>
